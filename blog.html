                <p></p>
                <p>You are one of very few people who will read this and you are very cool for it. Thank you for being here. 
                    This site is a both a work in process and a masterpiece in my eyes. While making this I wanted to be sure that I wasn't just doing it to have it be done.
                    The real purpose of this was to get a better overall understanding of this process, to learn. So every word you read, every button you press, every colour, font, size, shape... everything,
                    was a choice I made and was put there intentionally. I was held back from completing this because I wanted to really feel like I learned something while doing this, and now looking back
                    I can see hours of my life compressed into .html files. At the peak of this mountain, I'm looking across to so many others that I still want to climb-- so many features I want to add and new projects I want to work on.
                    Here, I will post about my creative endeavours with the goal of documenting it for myself, and on the off chance someone comes along and feels inspired by this, I hope you enjoy too.</p>
